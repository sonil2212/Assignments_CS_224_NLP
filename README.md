Course Name : http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html

Instruted By : Prof Chris Manning and Richard Socher

Topics Covered : Word Vectors, Language Models RNN, LSTM and GRU, Attention models etc

AI Framework : Tensorflow



Motivated by these leactures I tried to implement RNN (**rnn.py**) without using any AI framework. Purpose of this excercise is to understand and implement the underlying Math, used for gradient and thus the derivative calculation.
