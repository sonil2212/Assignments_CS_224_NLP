2019-06-04 17:29:40,952:WARNING: From /home/sonil/Documents/learning/nlp deep learning/cs_224/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/embedding_ops.py:132: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
2019-06-04 17:29:41,232:WARNING: From q1_window.py:248: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
2019-06-04 17:29:41,243:WARNING: From q1_window.py:273: to_float (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
2019-06-04 17:29:41,244:WARNING: From q1_window.py:275: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
